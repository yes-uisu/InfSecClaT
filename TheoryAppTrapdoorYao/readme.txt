Yao, Andrew Chi-Chih, “Theory and Applications of Trapdoor Functions” (Extended Abstract), 23rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS ’82), IEEE Computer Society, 1982, pp. 80-91. 


This influential paper introduces a number of notions and techniques that are essential to modern complexity-based cryptography, including computational indistinguishability as a basis for characterizing pseudorandom generators, and the use of one-way functions as a complexity-theoretic basis for obtaining cryptographic security via pseudorandomness. Yao also introduces ideas which have had a major impact in other areas such as computational information theory and derandomization.
