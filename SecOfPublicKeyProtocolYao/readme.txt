Dolev, Danny and Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, “On the security of public key protocols,” IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol. 29, Num. 2, 1983, pp. 198-207. 

The authors introduce a model for the analysis of cryptography-based security protocols which has become known as the Dolev-Yao model, and is the basis for many current approaches to formal verification of such protocols.
