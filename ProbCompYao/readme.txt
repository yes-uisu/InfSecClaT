Yao, Andrew Chi-Chih, “Probabilistic Computations: Toward a Unified Measure of Complexity” (Extended Abstract), 18th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS ’77), IEEE Computer Society, 1977, pp. 222-227. 

This paper considers probability in computation from two perspectives: probability distributions on inputs, and the use randomization in algorithms. The two perspectives are unified with Yao’s min-max principle, which states that the worst-case expected running time of a randomized algorithm for a problem is equal to the average-case running time of any deterministic algorithm, for the worst-case distribution on problem inputs.
